Welcome to the Equestria CLST Pipeline wiki! One can easily navigate towards different help files.
As a student, one probably wants to use the User guide. Teachers and administrators can look in the Teacher location. 
This contains information on adding new languages and configuring everything!
Developers and maintainers can look on the Developer tab.
